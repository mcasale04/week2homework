			 <p>I'm Maria Casale. I'm 30 years old and right know trying to change my career path. My studies background
				were focused on Early Childhood Education.
				However, i have been researching about which path should i take for a new career. The reason why i have
				decided to give my career a change was because i'm no longer teaching. Since i moved to the USA i have
				been working in some other areas.
				Two years ago, i started working on Expedia Gorup which is the main company of www.expedia.com,
				www.hotels.com, etc and from then i have been interested more on how to develop websites and the
                technical field. </p>

         <div class="row">
           <div class="col-sm-12" id="para2">

			 <p>To achieve this goal and become a software developer. I applied to a coding bootcamp at SMU in which in
				about 6 month i will be able to do all this and be prepared to work as a developer.
				Some of the reasons that pushed me to chose this career were being able to solve problems. There is
				nothing more sastisfying than solve problems that have been around for a while.
				Also, i can apply my teaching creativity putting myself in other people shoes to provide solutions and
                create new stuff. </p>
